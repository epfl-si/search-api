D. from the University of Liège in the LASSC laboratory of Prof. Kalitventzeff (former president of the European working party on computer aided process engineering). This laboratory was one of the pioneering laboratory in the field of Computer Aided Process Engineering.\nIn the group of Professor Kalitventzeff, I have worked on the development and the applications of data reconciliation, process modelling and optimisation techniques in the chemical process industry, my experience ranges from nuclear power stations to chemical plants. In the LASSC, I have been responsible from the developments in the field of rational use of energy in the industry. My first research topic has been the methodological development of process integration techniques, combining the use of pinch based methods and of mathematical programming: e.g. for the design of multiperiod heat exchanger networks or Mixed integer non linear programming techniques for the optimal management of utility systems. Fronted with applications in the industry, my work then mainly concentrated on the optimal integration of utility systems considering not only the energy requirements but the cost of the energy requirements and the energy conversion systems. I developed methods for analysing and integrating the utility system, the steam networks, combustion (including waste fuel), gas turbines or other advanced energy conversion systems (cogeneration, refrigeration and heat). The techniques applied uses operation research tools like mixed integer linear programming and exergy analysis. In order to evaluate the results of the utility integration, a new graphical method for representing the integration of the utility systems has been developed. By the use of MILP techniques, the method developed for the utility integration has been extended to handled site scale problems, to incorporate environmental constraints  and reduce the water usage. This method (the Effect Modelling and Optimisation method) has been successfully applied to the chemical plants industry, the pulp and paper industry and the power plant. Instead of focusing on academic problems, I mainly developed my research based on industrial applications that lead to valuable and applicable patented results. Recently the methods developed have been extended to realise the thermoeconomic optimisation of integrated systems like fuel cells. My present R&D work concerns the application of multi-objective optimisation strategies in the design of processes and integrated energy conversion systems.\nSince 2001, Im working in the Industrial Energy Systems Laboratory (LENI) of Ecole Polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL) where Im leading the R&D activities in the field of Computer Aided Analysis and Design of Industrial Energy Systems with a major focus on sustainable energy conversion system development using thermo-economic optimisation methodologies. A part from the application and the development of process integration techniques, that remains my major field of expertise, the applications concern :\nRational use of water and energy in Industrial processes and industrial production sites : projects with NESTLE, EDF, VEOLIA and Borregaard (pulp and paper).Energy conversion and process design : biofuels from waste biomass (with GASNAT, EGO and PSI), water dessalination and waste water treatment plant (VEOLIA), power plant design (ALSTOM), Energy conversion from geothermal sources (BFE). Integrated energy systems in urban areas : together with SCANE and SIG (GE) and IEA annexe 42 for micro-cogeneration systems.\n\nI as well contributed to the definition of the 2000 Watt society and to studies concerning the emergence of green technologies on the market in the frame of the Alliance for Global Sustainability.",

      "published_in": "Acs Infectious Diseases",
      "year": 2021,
      "abstract": "P. aeruginosa (PA) continues to pose a threat to global public health due to its high levels of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). The ongoing AMR crisis has led to an alarming shortage of effective treatments for resistant microbes, and hence there is a pressing demand for the development of novel antimicrobial interventions. The potential use of antivirulence therapeutics to tackle bacterial infections has attracted considerable attention over the past decades as they hamper the pathogenicity of target microbes with reduced selective pressure, minimizing the emergence of resistance. One such approach is to interfere with the PA pqs quorum sensing system which upon the interaction of PqsR, a Lys-R type transcriptional regulator, with its cognate signal molecules 4-hydroxy-2-heptylquinoline (HHQ) and 2-heptyl-3-hydroxy-4-quinolone (PQS), governs multiple virulence traits and host-microbe interactions. In this study, we report the hit identification and optimization of PqsR antagonists using virtual screening coupled with whole cell assay validation. The optimized hit compound 61 ((R)-2-(4-(3-(6-chloro-4-oxoquinazolin-3(4H)-yl)-2-hydroxypropoxy)phenyl)acetonitrile) was found to inhibit the expression of the PA P-pqsA promoter controlled by PqsR with an IC50 of 1 mu M. Using isothermal titration calorimetry, a K-d of 10 nM for the P-qsR ligand binding domain (PqsR(LBD)) was determined for 61. Furthermore, the crystal structure of 61 with PqsR(LBD) was attained with a resolution of 2.65 angstrom. Compound 61 significantly reduced levels of pyocyanin, PQS, and HHQ in PAO1-L, PA14 lab strains and PAK6085 clinical isolate. Furthermore, this compound potentiated the effect of ciprofloxacin in early stages of biofilm treatment and in Galleria mellonella infected with PA. Altogether, this data shows 61 as a potent PqsR inhibitor with potential for hit to lead optimization toward the identification of a PA QS inhibitor which can be advanced into preclinical development.",
